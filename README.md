# The-Labyrinth
A Command Line Input game done using C++ from back in the old TURBO C++ days. This was originally done as a part of my school project!

Compiled on TURBO C++'s inbuilt compiler hosted on a x86 based DOSbox
Hence only expect this to run on 32bit Operating systems
I will try and port this to the newer C++ in the coming days

## Installation
There're no particular steps, just grab the latest release *.exe and run it.
Currently only supports 32bit OSs


*Gimme a pull request if you want to fix anything/help me in porting to the newer C++ standards*
